## Introduction

The Real-Time Battery Monitoring System is designed to effectively obtain real-time battery data, estimate battery life, and monitor charging and discharging times using machine learning, IoT devices, and applications. The system consolidates all relevant data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. This project aims to provide accurate and actionable insights into battery performance, ensuring optimal usage and longevity.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Acquisition:** Continuously collect battery data using IoT sensors.
- **Battery Life Estimation:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict battery life based on historical and real-time data.
- **Charging and Discharging Monitoring:** Track and estimate charging and discharging times accurately.
- **User Interface:** Display all collected data and insights through an intuitive and interactive UI.

## Architecture

The system architecture is divided into three main components:

1. **IoT Devices:**
   - Sensors and microcontrollers to collect battery data.
   - Communication modules to transmit data to the server.

2. **Backend:**
   - Flask server to receive and process data.
   - Machine learning models for estimating battery life and monitoring charging/discharging times.
   - Database to store historical and real-time data.

3. **Frontend:**
   - Web application to display data, graphs, and insights.
   - Interactive UI designed using Figma (design available [here](https://www.figma.com/design/AFeubQlcjA0Vzfe0NsmcNS/LBM-GROUP-4?node-id=0-1)).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **IoT Devices:** Arduino, Raspberry Pi
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Database:** MySQL, MongoDB
- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS
- **Design Tools:** Figma

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/battery-monitoring-system.git
   cd battery-monitoring-system
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Install Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Start the Flask server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the React application:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **IoT Device Setup:**
   - Upload the Arduino/Raspberry Pi code from the `iot_devices` directory to your respective devices.

## Usage

1. **Deploy IoT Devices:** Place the IoT devices near the batteries to collect data.
2. **Start Backend and Frontend Servers:** Ensure the servers are running.
3. **Access the Web Application:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view real-time battery data and insights.
4. **Monitor Battery Performance:** Use the interactive UI to analyze battery life, charging, and discharging times.
